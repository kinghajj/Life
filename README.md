This is essentially a rewrite of a program I wrote in Clojure. Then, the purpose
was to play with Clojure's concurrency features; now, it's to play with the new
lens library and gloss.

The code is still in an extremely early stage, so don't expect much yet.
Eventually, there will be organisms controlled by some kind of AI to find food
and mates. Offspring will inherit characteristics from their parents. The
weights for the AI could be subject to a genetic algorithm.
